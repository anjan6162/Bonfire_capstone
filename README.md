## Business Problem Statement
A retail convenience chain, Maverik, fuels adventures in more than 380 locations across 12 western states. Maverik is known for premium BonFire food, diesel and unleaded fuel, and in-store merchandise. The company is on an expansion spree and as part of its growth, it recently acquired “ Kum & Go” nearly doubling its store count.

The company is planning to open 30 new stores yearly in a new market, and it needs to forecast daily sales for the new store. This is crucial for financial planning and return on investment (ROI) assessment for these new stores. The challenge lies in predicting the first-year sales for these newly acquired stores accurately.

We have limited amount of data; therefore, we will be using currently available historical dataset to address analytical problems we will be addressing in this project are identifying trends and patterns in sales data, understanding the relationship between sales and other factors, and identifying outliers and anomalies. By addressing these analytical problems, we will be able to build a sales forecasting model.

We will develop a sales forecasting model that can accurately predict daily sales for the new store. We will be using a variety of forecasting methods, such as time series analysis, regression analysis, causal analysis, and machine learning. The model will be evaluated by comparing its prediction to actual sales data from a holdout dataset. The model performance will be evaluated using industry-standard metrics such as Forecast Accuracy Metrics (e.g. MAE, MAPE, RMSE) and its ability to update forecasts dynamically in response to new data.

This sales forecasting model will help the company to make informed decisions about staffing, inventory, and marketing for the new stores. This can help the company to maximize its profits and minimize its losses while maintaining customer satisfaction.
